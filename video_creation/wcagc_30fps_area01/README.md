Passing videos just fall short of the WCAG Classic[^1] area threshold.

[^1]: The WCAG Classic area threshold is 25% of any 341x256 subset of the screen as given in a note to a definition.
This 341x256 rectangle was calculated with WCAG 2.0 when 15-inch and 17-inch cathode ray tube displays were commonplace.
These old screens had generally larger pixels than the CSS pixels of today.
