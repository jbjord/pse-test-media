**Description:** These videos are to test if algorithms are properly counting alternating luminance flashes.
According to standards, transitions that contribute to a hazardous sequence of flashes must alternate light to dark and dark to light.
These videos only have a single flashing area that covers slightly more than 25% of the screen and are thus applicable to most standards.
