**Description:** These videos have two flashing areas: a target pattern and an interfering pattern. 
The patterns only show in the "bright" state and do not show in the "dark" state.
In some videos, the target and interfering patterns are out of sync.
In other videos, the target and interfering patterns are synchronized, except for a single flash.
Interfering patterns exceed the area (if they were displayed alone) and luminance thresholds, but not the count threshold.
Passing videos only have one dimension that passes at a time per area, with other dimensions exceeding thresholds by a small amount.
