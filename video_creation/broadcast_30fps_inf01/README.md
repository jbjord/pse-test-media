**Description:** These videos have two flashing areas: a target pattern and an interfering pattern. 
In some videos, the target and interfering patterns are out of sync.
In other videos, the target and interfering patterns are synchronized, except for a single flash.
Interfering patterns exceed the area and luminance thresholds, but not the count threshold.
Passing videos only have one dimension that passes at a time per area, with other dimensions exceeding thresholds by a small amount.
