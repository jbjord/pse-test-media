The flashes change in both luminance and chromaticity.
Some luminance flash failures have a flash where one red flash does not meet the difference in chromaticity threshold.
Some red flash failures have a flash where one luminance flash does not meet the luminance difference threshold.
Some videos will fail both red and luminance guidelines.
Failing videos only exceed the trace24 guidelines by a small amount.
Passing videos only have one dimension that passes at a time, with other dimensions exceeding thresholds by a small amount.
