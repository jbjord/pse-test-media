**Description:** These videos are a selection of multi-colro red flash videos that only have a single flashing area. 
The flashes use multiple colors such that one is a saturated red (or nearly saturated red in the passing case) 
and a non-red color that is around 0.2 units away on the 1976 UCS diagram.
Failing videos only exceed the trace24 guidelines by a small amount.
Passing videos only have one dimension that passes at a time, with other dimensions exceeding thresholds by a small amount.
